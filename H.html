Korean dramas (Korean: 한국 드라마; RR: Hanguk deurama), more popularly known as K-dramas, are television series in the Korean language, made in South Korea.

They are popular worldwide, especially in Asia, partially due to the spread of Korean popular culture (the "Korean Wave"), and their widespread availability via streaming services which often offer subtitles in multiple languages.[citation needed] Many K-dramas have been adapted throughout the world, and some have had great impact in other countries.[citation needed] Some of the most famous dramas have been broadcasted via traditional television channels in other countries. For example, Dae Jang Geum (2003) was sold to 150 countries.[1]

Korean dramas have attracted international attention for their fashion, style and culture. Their rise in popularity has led to a great boost to fashion lines. However, various Korean dramas have also been criticized for their attempts to take advantage of such popularity to distort, rewrite or whitewash Korea's history, especially during South Korea's dictatorship regimes or the nation's historical periods.[2][3] As they constitute an important aspect of South Korea's soft power projection to "brand and publicize" the country, some K-dramas have also been criticized by Korean nationalists who feel they do not adequately "glorify the nation" enough.[4]
